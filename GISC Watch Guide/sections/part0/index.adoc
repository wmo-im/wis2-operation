== PART 0. Introduction
The overall service performance of the WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS2) relies on the operational quality of all Global Services. The WIS2 monitoring procedure was launched in April 2025, succeeding the WIS1 Watch, which had been active from 2017 through 2024.
This Guide was first developed in 2020 to standardize the procedures for GISC Watch operation in accordance with the Resolution 57 (Cg-18) and the feedbacks from GISC based on their experience of the WISC Watch practice. This 2025 edition aims at adapting the procedures to WIS2. It is intended to assist GISCs in fulfilling their GISC Watch responsibilities.

This guide presents the procedures to be used:

1. Procedures for Take over
2. Procedures for Monitoring
3. Procedures for Issue Management
4. Procedures for Hand over
5. Procedure for Escalation
