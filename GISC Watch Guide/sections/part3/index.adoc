== PART III. Procedures for Issues Management

The WIS2 ticketing system is provided and operated by WMO : https://jira.wmo.int.

The GISC in charge needs to review the tickets:
•	Frequency: at least once or twice a week.
•	Focus on “stalled” ticket”: send reminder for tickets inactive for more than 2 weeks
•	Hopefully, most tickets are created automatically by the GISC Monitoring.

Here is the procedure to review Jira Tickets for the GISC Watch:

1.	Connect to https://jira.wmo.int (request credentials to WMO Secretariat if needed)
2.	Select WIS2 IMS Project
3.	Remove « DONE » from Status:

4.	Work with tickets:
◦	Review ticket list and send reminders (inside tickets) for tickets inactive for more than 2 weeks.
◦	Assign tickets to relevant Assignees for the tickets with status “TRIAGE” (new tickets)
