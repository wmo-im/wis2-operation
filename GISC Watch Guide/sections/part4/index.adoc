== PART IV. Procedures for Handover

=== (a) Handover Process

1. The GISC currently on duty is responsible for sending the handover report to the next GISC in the roster.
2. If no confirmation is received:
   - The current GISC must follow up with a reminder.
   - GISC Watch duties must be maintained until the next GISC acknowledges receipt of the handover.
3. If there is still no response:
   - The GISC following the next one in the roster should be contacted to agree on a revised handover date.
   - The purpose is to ensure continuity by splitting the remaining period between the two GISCs if needed.
