== PART II.Procedures for Monitor
Procedure to use by the GISC on duty during the monitoring period.

Basic Principles:

1. The GISC Watchâ€™s goal is focusing on the Global Services level (Global Broker, Global Cache, Global Discovery Catalogue, Global Monitoring).
2. Issues regarding data coming from WIS2Nodes are manages by GISCs according to their AoR (Area of Responsibility). The GISC Watch can pinpoint issues to the GISCs, but this is not mandatory.
3. A large part of the monitoring activity is already performed on the Global Monitoring level, with JIRA tickets to be automatically initiated.

The following table shall be filled in, by checking Global Monitoring metrics (see detailed information how to get the figures after the table):
